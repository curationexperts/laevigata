# NOTE: If you want to change the name of a program, change the term value,
# but NOT the id value. Id values must match the admin sets that are expected.
# If you are adding a new option, you must also ensure it is added to
# `config/emory/admin_sets.yml`, both in this code base and on every server
# where this code is deployed.
